        <h2>Hi, Cutie</h2>
        <p>How are you? Hope you're doing good. Since I left I felt a burden or guilt of not expressing my emotions towards you. I also think that it's wrong to not letting you know how I feel about you.</p>
        <p>I don't know what you think of me and at this point it doesn't matter. You can say you were the only reason that I used to come to the office every day. I wouldn't go to this extent to express myself if it wasn't that serious.</p>
        <p>I don't know if you will be able to read this or not. But writing this has relaxed me. In the end, I just want you to know that from the day of joining my eyes only gazed upon your beautiful eyes and nothing else.</p>
        <p>I wish I could continue my work so I could have stargazed at the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. If we are on the same page, then here's my number:<br>123456789<br>With love.</p>
